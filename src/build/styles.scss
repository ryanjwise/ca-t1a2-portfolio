Used to control more complex arrays containing two or more objects in each item.
As these arrays are typically used as navigation aids, the header is styled as a clickable button
and unless overridden other elements are hidden on a mobile device.

Breaks into 3 main componants:
1. Header button with clickable a tag
2. Image
3. Contextual infomration

This is used on both the projects page and the master blog page.

Provides a baseline control for repeating elements flowing vertically down the page.
It is mostly overriden in projects.scss, and isn't used elsewhere. Some work could probably be done to refactor and remove this styling.
