# Portfolio Site

This project was built as a part of the Coder Academy fast track to web development course.
The aim is to produce a portfolio site with which we can showcase our work as we progress and to help reinforce our knowledge of HTML and CSS before moving onto other languages.

## Deployment

The site can either be opened locally using the files found in the `src` directory, or found deployed on [Netlify at https://ryanjwise.netlify.app/](https://ryanjwise.netlify.app/)

## About

### Functionality / features

The site is designed to showcase existing and future work with simple access to:

- Information About Me
- An expansible list of highlight projects
- An expansible index of blog posts
- Contact Details/ or methods to get in touch with me

It is designed to be mobile first, and responsive across mobile, tablet and desktop devices.

It uses flexbox and some grids to ensure that content can be added to various arrays without additional styling requirements.

No use of JavaScript, minimal fetches, and the use of optimised images aim to make the page very performative, responding very well to lighthouse reporting:

## What's Next?

Whilst the site has reached what I would consider minimum viable product, there are still features that I have yet to implement. These are listed below:

- Make Header and footer fixed elements on the page.
  - This will add to the terminal asthetic of the site.
- Add clickable links to document sections allowing the user to jump either back to the top of the current page, or forward/backward through projects etc.
- Replace placeholder text and images with actual content.
- Animate Page Headers (h1 & h2) with a typewriter effect, with a trailing input cursor blinking on a loop at the end.
- Animation to smooth out hover effect.
