# Portfolio Site

This project was built as a part of the Coder Academy fast track to web development course.
The aim is to produce a portfolio site with which we can showcase our work as we progress and to help reinforce our knowledge of HTML and CSS before moving onto other languages.

## Deployment

The site can either be opened locally using the files found in the `src` directory, or found deployed on [Netlify at https://ryanjwise.netlify.app/](https://ryanjwise.netlify.app/)
